**Go with Soundstripe’s Enterprise API.**

* **All-in-one license that’s safe for ads** – every track is pre-cleared “in perpetuity,” including YouTube and paid-media use, so you never worry about copyright flags. ([soundstripe.com][1])
* **Huge curated catalog** – thousands of songs (new ones drop weekly), searchable by genre, mood, BPM, key, instruments, stems, etc., and optimized for short-form video. ([soundstripe.com][1])
* **Straightforward REST design** – authenticate once, then hit `/songs`, filter with query params (`genre=hip-hop&bpm_min=80&bpm_max=95`…), grab the `audio_file.url`, and you’re done. Full reference is public. ([docs.soundstripe.com][2])
* **Unlimited downloads & no per-track paperwork** – one subscription covers every ReelForge user session; scale without counting licenses. ([soundstripe.com][1])
* **Battle-tested for ad platforms** – Waymark and other video-ad builders already embed it, so the legal/UX edge cases you’ll face are solved. ([soundstripe.com][1])

**Integration in three quick steps**

1. **Get enterprise key** – fill the short form → Soundstripe sends client-ID/secret in <24 h.
2. **Search & select**

   ```http
   GET /v1/songs?mood=upbeat&duration_max=0:60
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
   ```

   Parse JSON, surface previews to your ad generator, let it pick the best match.
3. **Download & log usage** – fetch `audio_file.url`; optionally call `/digital-usages/youtube-code` if the user will upload to YouTube (clears ContentID automatically). ([docs.soundstripe.com][2])

That’s literally it—one API, zero copyright headaches, plug-and-play inside ReelForge’s FFmpeg pipeline.

*(If you ever need AI-generated tracks instead of a fixed catalog, Mubert API 3.0 is the runner-up, but for reliability, licensing clarity, and speed to “ship,” Soundstripe wins right now.)*
